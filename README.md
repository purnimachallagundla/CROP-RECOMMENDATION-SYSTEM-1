# CROP-RECOMMENDATION-SYSTEM-1
Crop Yield Prediction using Machine Learning. This project applies Random Forest Regression on the Crop Recommendation dataset, with preprocessing, feature engineering, evaluation (MAE, RMSE, RÂ²), and visualization (correlation heatmap, true vs predicted, residuals, feature importances).
